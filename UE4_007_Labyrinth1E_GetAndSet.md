## 007.001 | Removing 'yaw-creep' by Getting and Setting values

<br>

### The problem

Okay - I totally just made up the term 'yaw-creep' - but it describes a small issue with our core gameplay mechanic.

Let's demonstrate:

<br>

- Play-test the game
- With your mouse, 'draw circles' - ie. keep making circles with your mouse and observe what the *Floor* Actor does..

<br>

As you continually pitch and roll, the *Floor* Actor becomes offset around its *yaw*.. It gradually creeps around the *Z-axis* and we don't want that because it'll mess up the synchronous between the orientation of our mouse-pad and the game-board - resulting in awkward gameplay.

<br><br>

### Getting values

We're now going to solve this problem with some new and versatile coding tricks.

<br>

- Go into your **Level Blueprint**
- Locate your *EventTick* sequence, select the **AddActorWorldRotation** node and delete it
>It's served us well so far - but we need a little more control
- Click and drag out from the Reference to **Floor**'s blue (Object) output pin and release
- Drill down to **Utilities Â» Transformation** - this is where we previously found *AddActorWorldRotation*
- Keep scrolling down and locate and choose **GetActorRotation**

>If you read the return pin's tooltip, you'll notice that the Return Value [variable] is of type 'Rotator'
<br>

- **Right-click** the **GetActorRotation** pin's **Return Value** pin and choose **Split Struct Pin**
>We now have access to the three axis values
- **Right-click** one of the new **Return Value** pins (X, Y or Z) and choose **Recombine Struct Pin** to collapse them back down to a single return pin
> (Just wanted you to see that a *Rotation* variable actually contains three values)
- Click and drag off the singular **Return Value** pin and release
- Start typing **Break Rotator** and choose it when it becomes available
> This is another way to access those three values
