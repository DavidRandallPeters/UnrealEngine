## 009.001 | Creating geometry using BSP brushes

<br>

Let's start adding some walls to our labyrinth so that this poject begins qualifying as a game.

We'll being by adding a floor plane which we'll later cut a hole in so that the marble has an escape point.

We do already have a floor.. but we won't use this one in the end-product. So:

<br>

- Select the **Floor** Actor, **Shift-select** the **Marble** Actor and move them off to the side - somewhere out of the way
