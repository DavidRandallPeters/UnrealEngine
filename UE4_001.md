## 001.001 | Getting started

Let's get straight into it.

- Fire up the **Epic Games Launcher**
- If you haven't already, create an account with Epic Games
- If/when you have an account ready, log in to it
- Locate the **Unreal Engine** tab at the top of the launcher and select it
- Hit the **drop-down arrow** to the right of the big yellow launch button and double-check that you're using the latest version of UE4 available in this lab. If not, select the latest version.
- Hit the big yellow **Launch** button  
<br>

Note: You can also launch your desired version via the *Library* tab.

## 001.002 | Creating a project

You're now being presented with the *Unreal Project Browser.*

You *may* see a list of varioius industries that UE4 is used within:

>1. Game
>2. Film, Television and Live Events
>3. Achitecture, Engineering and Construction
>4. Automotive, Product Design and Manufacturing

>(Game Development is by no means UE4's only application)  


<br><br>
.. Or you may be looking at a range of Game templates.

- If you see the applications listed above, choose **Game** 
- From the range of *Game* templates, choose the **Blank** project
- In *Project Settings,* we have the option of targeting *Desktop/Console* or *Mobile/Tablet*. Choose **Desktop/Console**.

>Note: your choice here can later be changed within the editor after launch (in the *Target Hardware* section of *Project Settings*)  


<br><br>

- We can also tweak the quality / performance characteristics of the project (leave this set to **Maximum Quality**) and choose whether to include Starter Content or not - *DO* choose **With Starter Content**
- We do want to create a Blueprint project rather than a C++ project - so leave that as it is - and the latest versions of UE4 allow real-time raytracing (which is rather exciting) - but leave **Raytracing Disabled** for now.  
<br><br>

![ProjectSettings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36719180/90495055-41984c00-e198-11ea-8b40-2238dd3ecfb9.png)  
<br><br>


- Double-check the project's folder location
- And give it a name: **MarbleRun**  

>Note: This needs to be written in the CamelCase naming convention - spaces are not allowed  


<br><br>

- Finally, hit **Create Project** and your new project will initialise.  
<br><br>

## 001.002 | The Unreal Editor  

Having spent time using Unity, what you see now will feel familiar.. yet different.  

![UnrealEditor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36719180/90500101-8921d680-e19e-11ea-939c-b39ad9477ed9.png)  


Some key differences:

>- What Unity calls the 'Heirarchy' is here called the *World Outliner*
>- What Unity calls the 'Inspector' is here called the *Details* panel
>- What Unity calls the 'Assets' panel is here called the *Content Browser*
>- What Unity calls GameObjects, Unreal calls 'Actors'

<br>
- Take some time to familiarise yourself with navigation in the viewport.  
<br>

Your primary hotkeys are **W**, **E** and **R**.  

By all means rearrange the panels to make yourself comfortable.
