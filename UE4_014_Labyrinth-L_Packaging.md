## 014.001 | Project settings

<br>

- In the top menu bar, go to **Edit » Project Settings**

> Here's your chance to determine the game's icon as it will be displayed in file browsers

- Make an icon measuring 192px² and add it as the **Project Thumbnail** - (or you can use this one that I slapped together)
