## 014.001 | Project settings

<br>

- In the top menu bar, go to **Edit » Project Settings**

> Here's your chance to determine the game's icon as it will be displayed in the *Epic Games Launcher* and file browsers

- Make an icon measuring 192px² and add it as the **Project Thumbnail** - (or you can use this one that I slapped together)

- Enter a name for your game in the **Project Name** field

> There are other details here that you can fill out, if you like. But We probably don't need to worry too much about these for this particular project

- Under **Project**, select the **Maps * Modes** section

> You may alread have noticed that the UE4 editor often launches in a different level to the one you're working on. Here's where you can change that.
> It's also where we'll determine which level the built game should use.
