### Removing 'Yaw-Creep'

I totally just made up that term. But it describes a small issue with our core gameplay mechanic:

- Play-test the game
- With your mouse, 'draw circles' - ie. keep making circles with your mouse and observe what the *Floor* Actor does..

> As you continually pitch and roll, the *Floor* Actor becomes offset around its *yaw* (Z-axis).. It gradually creeps around and we don't want that because
