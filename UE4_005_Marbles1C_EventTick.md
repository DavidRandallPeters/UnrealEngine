## 005.001 | Mouse Input

<br>

We'll now make some changes so that we can control the *Floor* Actor smoothly - using mouse input.

<br>

- Go into your **Level Blueprint**
- Find some empty space in the graph under the *Key Input System* we built
- **Right-click** in empty graph space
- Scroll down the *Actions* menu and expand **Input**
- Locate **Mouse Events** and expand it
- Select **Mouse X**

<br>

We'll need *Mouse Y*, too:

- Either repeat the above steps to create a **Mouse Y** Event node, or
- **Right-click** in empty graph space and start typing **Mouse Y** (be sure to select the option that's in the *Mouse Events* section)
