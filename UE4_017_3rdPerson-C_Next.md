## 017.001 | Building Lighting

<br>

If you receive the message 'LIGHTING NEEDS TO BE REBUILT', this means that you've employed light or objects that are available to be added to the game's precaluclated lightmaps.

You can keep working with the message for as long as you like, but should you want to do a build (and see things as they'd look in the game):

<br>

- Use the **Build** dropdown above the main viewport and choose **Build Lighting Only**

> Note that you can use **Build Â» Lighting Quality** to determine the quality of the lighting build. During development, *Preview* quality will be fine.
